## Teen Mala Zedik
My friend [Aerpenium](https://www.deviantart.com/aerpenium) did all the artwork for Teen Mala Zedik. Thank you sooooo much Aerpenium! I love your work.

Teen Mala Zedik is as it sounds, a younger version of Mala Zedik as he was on the journey toward adulthood.

### Rafa
Rafa is the name of the companion that follows Mala Zedik around. If you recall from the first image of Mala Zedik, there was a small golden object with wings. Well, that's Rafa!

In this image, Rafa is the staff that Mala Zedik is currently wielding. Why does Rafa look like a staff? Well, that is because Rafa is in an inactive state. When activated, Rafa turns into the flying companion that can be seen in the other Mala Zedik image.

## Headband
In this image of Mala Zedik, he still has his youth headband which is a symbol of youth. It's used to cover the crystal in their forward until the day they come into adulthood. More information bout this maybe another time... But I did want to point that out!
